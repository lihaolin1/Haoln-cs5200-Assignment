For my assignment 2, I make the create, trigger and insert in a 
same .sql file, which name is create_trigger_and_insert.sql
If you can't run the create_trigger_and_insert file, you can find 
the workbech information in submission.txt, and then you can 
directly access my database on AWS plateform.

And if you can't run delete.sql or update.sql or view.sql or retrieve
.sql, you can use all_in.sql which include all information about delete,
update, view and retrieve

Thank you!
